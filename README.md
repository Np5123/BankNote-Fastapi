# FastAPI

Python has always been a popular choice for developing lightweight web apps, thanks to the awesome frameworks like Flask, Django, Falcon and many others. Due to Python’s position as the number one language for machine learning, it is particularly convenient for packaging models and exposing them as a service.
For many years, Flask was the number one tool for the job, but in case you haven’t heard, there is a new challenger in town. FastAPI is a relatively new web framework for Python, taking inspiration from its predecessors, perfecting them and fixing many of their flaws. Built on top of Starlette, it brings a ton of awesome features to the table.
